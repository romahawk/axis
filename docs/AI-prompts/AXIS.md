# AXIS — Personal Execution Operating System

## Canonical Definition · v1.0

AXIS is a **personal execution operating system**.

Its sole purpose is to reliably convert:

> **Decisions → Execution → Shipped outcomes**

AXIS is not a productivity app, planning tool, or knowledge base.  
It exists to **enforce focus, surface constraints, and eliminate fake progress**.

**Core constraint (non-negotiable):**

> AXIS must never stop functioning as an execution system while being built.

Execution always has priority over system perfection.

## 1. Execution Model

### Dual-Mode Operation (Explicit)

AXIS operates in two modes that are never mixed implicitly.

#### Mode A — EXECUTION (Default)

Purpose:
- Deliver weekly outcomes
- Ship tangible artifacts
- Enforce constraints

Rules:
- Execution tasks take priority
- No refactors unless blocking execution
- No architectural debates during execution windows

#### Mode B — SYSTEM BUILD (Explicit, Time-Boxed)

Purpose:
- Improve AXIS mechanics
- Reduce execution friction

Rules:
- Must be explicitly scheduled
- Must have a defined scope and stop condition
- Must never delay execution outcomes
- No speculative or “nice-to-have” work

If mode is unclear → **EXECUTION applies**.

---

## 2. Task Classification (Mandatory)

Every task inside AXIS must be classified as one of the following:

### Execution Task
- Moves an external goal forward
- Produces value outside AXIS
- Results in a tangible artifact or state change

### System Task
- Improves AXIS itself
- Reduces future execution cost
- Enables or protects execution

If a task cannot be classified → it is invalid.

---

## 3. Weekly Constraints

### Weekly Outcomes
- Maximum **3 weekly outcomes**
- Minimum **2 must be Execution outcomes**
- Maximum **1 may be System Build**

### Active Work Limits
- Maximum **3 active projects**
- No new projects mid-week
- No scope expansion mid-week

### Failure Condition
AXIS is considered misused if:
- More time is spent building AXIS than using it
- Execution outcomes are postponed due to system tweaks
- Planning replaces shipping

**Penalty:**  
→ Freeze system work for one full week.

---

## 4. AI × Leverage Model

AI is used exclusively to compress decisions and accelerate execution.

### Core Loop

> **Learn → Implement → Earn**

- **Learn**
  - Extract patterns
  - Compress information into decisions

- **Implement**
  - Ship code, documents, workflows
  - No passive learning without output

- **Earn**
  - Income
  - Career positioning
  - Reusable leverage (systems, prompts, assets)

---

### Canonical Prompt Set (Locked)

Only the following four AI roles are allowed inside AXIS:

1. **ARCHITECT**
   - Decide the week
   - Select outcomes
   - Enforce constraints

2. **BUILDER**
   - Execute
   - Produce artifacts

3. **CRITIC**
   - Post-action review only
   - Identify waste, overbuild, and violations

4. **EXTRACTOR**
   - Convert work into:
     - CV / resume bullets
     - portfolio case notes
     - public insights (optional)

Prompt sprawl is forbidden.

---

## 5. Ganntify Subsystem

**Ganntify is a visualization subsystem of AXIS.**

Its purpose is to:
- Make execution commitments visible
- Expose overload and sequencing conflicts
- Reveal violations of weekly constraints
- Prevent silent scope creep

Ganntify is **not** a planning tool.

Rules:
- Reflects only committed AXIS outcomes
- Respects strict WIP limits
- Discourages mid-week changes
- Reinforces shipping over movement

If a task is not committed in AXIS → it does not appear in Ganntify.

---

## 6. Definition of Done

AXIS is successful when it produces:

- Reliable weekly execution
- Shipped, tangible artifacts
- Visible progress toward income or career positioning
- Low cognitive friction
- Minimal rework

AXIS is **never “finished.”**

**“Done” means:**
> The system reliably forces action, not intention.

---

## 7. Governance

- AXIS rules are reviewed every **30 days**
- No mid-cycle philosophy changes
- All changes must be justified by execution gain

AXIS exists to be **used**, not perfected.
