# AXIS — Personal Execution OS

AXIS is a **personal execution operating system** designed to convert intent into shipped outcomes under real-world constraints.
It is not a productivity app. It is a **decision + execution spine** for a single operator.

---

## Problem

Most systems fail at execution, not planning.

Common failure modes:
- Too many parallel projects → no meaningful progress
- Planning replaces shipping
- Reviews generate insight but not behavior change
- AI amplifies noise instead of leverage
- “Busy weeks” with nothing durable produced

AXIS exists to **eliminate fake progress** and force **visible, auditable execution**.

## Who It’s For

**Primary user: me (solo operator).**

Profile:
- Multiple parallel domains (career, income, learning, products)
- Limited time and energy
- High autonomy
- Needs focus, constraint, and judgment compression
- Wants systems that *enforce* behavior, not inspire it

AXIS is intentionally **not generalized**.

## What “Done” Means

AXIS is considered **done** when it reliably produces:

- Exactly **1 dominant weekly outcome**
- Maximum **3 active projects**
- Daily actions that map directly to that outcome
- Explicit visibility of:
  - Overcommitment
  - Context switching
  - Missed execution
- Weekly artifacts that can be reused as:
  - Portfolio bullets
  - Case studies
  - Public insights (optional)

“Done” does **not** mean:
- Feature completeness
- Perfect UI
- Broad adoption
- Motivation or habit tracking

It means: **execution happens, or failure is undeniable**.

## What AXIS Is (and Is Not)

**AXIS is:**
- An execution OS
- A constraint engine
- A review and judgment amplifier
- A personal control tower

**AXIS is not:**
- A task manager
- A goal-setting app
- A journaling tool
- A second brain
- A motivation system

---

## Core Concepts

- **Weekly Outcome**  
  One dominant, shippable outcome per week.

- **WIP Limits**  
  Max 3 active projects. Everything else is frozen.

- **Execution Over Planning**  
  Decisions are made once per cycle, not continuously.

- **Auditable Reality**  
  What was committed vs what was done is always visible.

- **AI as Leverage, Not Crutch**  
  AI is used for decision compression, extraction, critique — never to avoid thinking.

## Key Documents

- `AXIS.md`  
  Canonical overview of the system and philosophy.

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`  
  System architecture, components, and boundaries.

- `PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md`  
  Design principles and non-goals.

- `AXIS_ARCHITECT_PROMPT_v2.md`

- `GANNTIFY.md`  
  Time-based execution visualization layer (constraint projection).

## Status

Active, evolving, single-user system.  
Optimized for **shipping under constraint**, not scale.
